   <h2> Ingredients:</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>  2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li> 1 1/2 cups (300g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li> 4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li> 1 cup (240ml) whole milk, at room temperature</li>
    <li>  1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil or melted butter</li>
    <li>    2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>  1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>  1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
</ol>
    <strong>Optional Frosting</strong>
<ul>
<li>1 cup (225g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
<li>4 cups (480g) powdered sugar</li>
<li>2-3 tablespoons milk or cream</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>Food coloring </li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven and prepare pans: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch (23cm) round cake pans or line them with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
<li>Mix dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
<li>Combine wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with the vanilla extract until frothy. Gradually add the milk and vegetable oil (or melted butter) while continuing to beat until everything is well combined.</li>
<li>Combine wet and dry ingredients: Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a spatula or mixer on low speed to gently fold everything together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</li>
<li>Bake the cakes: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. The cakes should be golden brown and spring back when lightly touched.</li>
<li>Cool the cakes: Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.</li>
<li>Make the frosting (optional): In a mixing bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the milk (or cream) and vanilla extract, and continue to beat until the frosting is smooth and creamy. If desired, add food coloring to achieve your desired color.</li>
<li>Frost the cake: Once the cakes are completely cooled, place one layer on a serving plate or cake stand. Spread a layer of frosting on top, then place the second cake layer on top. Use the remaining frosting to frost the top and sides of the cake.</li>
<li>Decorate (optional): Decorate the cake with sprinkles, fresh fruit, chocolate shavings, or any other decorations you like.</li>
<li>Serve and enjoy: Your homemade vanilla sponge cake is now ready to be sliced and enjoyed! Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to several days.</li>
</ol>
